          My name is Nadezhda Yankulova. In 2019 I participated in a workshop
          for Christmas toys, where I met the idea of painting on glass. With
          the help of a brush, 3 colors of special glass paints, a ribbon and a
          light bulb I made my first glass gizmo- a Christmas tree toy. March
          2020 because of the Corona virus I stayed at home waiting to start
          working online. I decided to diversify my daily routine by ordering a
          set of basic glass paint colors, a brush and wine glasses to paint and
          give to my best friend who has a birthday the end of March. In the
          meantime, I've been studying ecology. While studying I realized how
          important it is to recycle and use every thing as long as we can, if
          possible, and not just throw it away after the first use. I then
          decided that my way of recycling would be painting and decorating. I
          started to paint on all kinds of glass objects under the motto "Let's
          breathe new life into something old" I collected from familiar
          bottles, light bulbs,glasses, jars and even records that no longer
          worked and actively created on them. But for recycling to be
          meaningful it wasn't enough to just paint, the junk had to find new
          owners. I made a page on Facebook - painting on glass and on Instagram
          -stuklorisuvane, thanks to them I introduced people to my idea and
          creativity and my objects came to life in their new home. You can see
          some of them in Gallery.
